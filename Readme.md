# MathOwlet

MathOwlet is an app for the youngest mathematicians, where they can learn addition and subtraction in a funny way. The child selects from three possible answers the correct one for a simple task such as 1+1=? or 3-?=2. It can help itself using abacus, where it assigns the operands and  counts the result. In the beginning, the addition tasks come from the number space from 0 to 5, where the unknown is the sum. Thereafter, the subtraction task will be interrogated from the same number space where the unknown is the difference. Further, more complex tasks are asked from the same number space, where the unknown is an addend or subtrahend. Only after all variants from the number space 0 to 5 have been answered, the tasks from the next number space are asked in the order described above.

## Features:
- Simple, child-friendly UI
- The state is saved after every correct answer
- Visual and acoustic feedback for the right or wrong answer
- The correct answer is synchronized with the Abacus
- Over 1000 unique tasks
- No adds, no in-app purchases
